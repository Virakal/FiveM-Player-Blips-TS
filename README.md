# Virakal Player Blips

A simple resource for [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) that adds map blips to all players.

## I Can't See Everybody

Currently, with [OneSync: Infinity](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/scripting-reference/onesync/) enabled this script can only add blips for users near to you. Set onesync to `legacy` or `off` to see everybody on the map but make sure you understand the implications of doing so!

## Options

Check the [fxmanifest](fxmanifest.lua) for configuration options.

## Other Languages

I have older versions made in [C#](https://github.com/Virakal/FiveM-Player-Blips-CS) and [Lua](https://github.com/Virakal/FiveM-Player-Blips).
